Problem Solving & Programming 1 (SOFT6018) - Lab Week 5

This lab should be done using Eclipse. It is installed on all the machines in the labs.

__________________________________________________

Write a program which uses the country array from last week's lab and does the following

.
Your program should have two classes MainProgram and CountryOperations

CountryOperations should have three methods which do the following:

	- A public method called calculateAverageCountryLength which calculates the average country name length and take the countryArray as a parameter and returns an int.
	- A public method called getNumberOfCountriesBeginnigWithLetterwhich counts the number of countries beginning with a letter or letters. It should take a String and the countryArrayas a parameters and return an int
	- A public method called printMenu which prints the menu to user and takes no parameter and returns nothing.

getNumberOfCountriesBeginnigWithLetter should output a sentence like "The number of countries beginning with Sp is 5"

__________________________________________________

MainProgram should contain the countryArray and a main method (like last week)

It should do the following :

	- Display a menu to the user asking if they want to :
	- 	1. Calculate the average country length
		2. Find the number of countries beginning with a letter sequence.
		3. Exit.
	- A Scanner should be used to capture the users input when choosing an option and also when they are asked for a letter sequence in Option 2
	- A while loop should keep running allowing them to keep choosing 1 or 2 as they wish. Once they enter 3 the program should exit.
	- It should create an instance of CountryOperations in main and call its methods as appropriate.
	- If the user enters an invalid option (i.e. Not 1,2 or 3) they should get this message "You have entered an invalid option."
